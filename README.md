CWScript
======
CWScript is a new programming language designed to eventually compile down to CosmWasm. This repository contains an MVP for CWScript, including language design, examples, and an ANTLR AST in Python.

One of the main goals of CWScript is to provide a simple syntax that allows developers to focus on the complexity of their ideas, rather than wrestling with syntax. The language is designed to be easy to read and write, while still allowing for powerful programming constructs.

## Installation
To use CWScript, you'll need to install a few dependencies:

1. Install the antlr4-tools package using pip:
```arduino
pip install antlr4-tools
```

2. Install Poetry, a Python package manager:
```arduino
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3
```

3. Install the project dependencies using Poetry:
```arduino
poetry install
```
